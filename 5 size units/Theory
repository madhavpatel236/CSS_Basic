---->>> in css we have a mejor two types of size units
        (i) absolute : The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
        (ii) relative : in the relative units our size will be change accroding to the device length and height.

        -we will always try to use the relative unit because if we use mobile and if we use laptop then our screen widht and height will be cahnge so this type unit was change accroding to them.

(i) absolute : 
            -Unit	Description
            -cm	centimeters
            -mm	millimeters
            -in	inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
            -px *	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
            -pt	points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
            -pc	picas (1pc = 12 pt)

(ii) relative : 
            Unit	Description	
            -em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size    of the current font)	
            -ex	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
            -ch	Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)	
            -rem	Relative to font-size of the root element	
            -vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
            -vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
            -vmin	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
            -vmax	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
            -%	Relative to the parent element

---->>> persentage (%) :
            - persentage is depend on the width and the hight of the devices.
            - it is dependent on the perent class. if we change the width of the perent then also size of the child or containor will be change.

---->>> em : 
                - Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like font-size, and font size of the element itself, in the case of other properties like width.
                - simplly means of em is em = parent size * how much em

---->>> viewport(vh,vw) :
                - viewport is depend on the width and the hight of the             devices.
                -viewport means our full screen.
                -vh means viewhight and vw means view width.
                - it is not dependent on the perent class. if we change the width of the parent then also size of the child or containor will not be change.
---->>> em : 
                - rem directly multiply with the 16px.
