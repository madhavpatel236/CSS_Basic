--->>>> Media Query :
                - Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or other characteristics such as screen resolution or browser viewport width.
                - Media types define the broad category of device for which the media query applies: all, print, screen. The type is optional (assumed to be all) except when using the not or only logical operators.
