---->>>>> float : 
            -The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

            - The float property can have one of the following values:
            left - The element floats to the left of its container
            right - The element floats to the right of its container
            none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text).This is default
            inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

---->>>>> clear :
            - When we use the float property, and we want the next element          below(not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.
            -The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.

            The clear property can have one of the following values:
            none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
            left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
            right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
            both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
            inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

---->>>>> Overflow : 
            - The overflow property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box.

            - This property specifies whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when an element's content is too big to fit in a specified area.

            - Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.

            Property Values : 
                -> visible-	The overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box. This is default	
                -> hidden-	The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible. Content can be scrolled programmatically (e.g. by setting scrollLeft or scrollTo())	
                -> clip-	The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible. Forbids scrolling, including programmatic scrolling.	
                -> scroll-	The overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content	
                -> auto- If overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar should be added to see the rest of the content
