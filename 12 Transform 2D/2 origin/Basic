--->>> transform-origin : The transform-origin CSS property sets the origin for an element's transformations.

--->>> The transform origin is the point around which a transformation is   applied. For example, the transform origin of the rotate() function is the center of rotation.In effect, this property wraps a pair of translations around the element's other transformations. The first translation moves the transform origin to the true origin at (0,0). Then the other transformations are applied, and because the transform originis at (0,0), those transformations act about the transform origin. Finally, the oppositetranslation is applied, moving the transform origin back to its originallocation. Consequently, this definition

--->>> Reading from right to left, translate(100%, -50%) is the translation to bring the transform origin to the true origin, rotate(45deg) is the original transformation, and translate(-100%, 50%) is the translation to restore the transform origin to its original location.

--->>> Values
        -->> (i) x-offset - Is a <length> or a <percentage> describing how far from the left edge of the box the origin of the transform is set.

        -->> (ii) offset-keyword - Is one of the left, right, top, bottom, or center keyword describing the corresponding offset.

        -->> (iii) y-offset - Is a <length> or a <percentage> describing how far from the top edge of the box the origin of the transform is set.

        -->> (iv) x-offset-keyword - Is one of the left, right, or center keyword describing how far from the left edge of the box the origin of the transform is set.

        -->> (v) y-offset-keyword - Is one of the top, bottom, or center keyword describing how far from the top edge of the box the origin of the transform is set.

        -->> (vi) z-offset - Is a <length> (and never a <percentage> which would make the statement invalid) describing how far from the user eye the z=0 origin is set.


----->>>>>> in short transform origin is the base point which we can rotet or impliment the othe property. if we give right top then our right top corner will the base position to perform the property in our case rotet.
