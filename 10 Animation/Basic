    Animations : for the animation implimentation we can write a position:relative;     because of the we can change the possion of this particular box or other things

(i) @keyframes Rule :
    - When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.
    - To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.

(ii) animation-duration: 
            - The animation-duration property defines how long an animation  should take to complete. If the animation-duration property is not specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s (0 seconds). 

(iii) animation-delay:
            - The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.

(iv) animation-iteration-count : 
            - The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run.

(v) animation-direction :
            - The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.

            - The animation-direction property can have the following values:
                -->normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
                -->reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
                -->alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
                -->alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards.

(vi) animation-timing-function : 
            - The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.

            - The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:
                --> ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
                --> linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
                --> ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
                --> ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
                --> ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
                --> cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

(vii) animation-fill-mode :
            - CSS animations do not affect an element before the first keyframe is played or after the last keyframe is played. The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior.

            - The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).

            - The animation-fill-mode property can have the following values:
                --> none - Default value. Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing

                --> forwards - The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)

                --> backwards - The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period

                --> both - The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both directions
